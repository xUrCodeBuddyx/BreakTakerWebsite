BreakTaker is a desktop application for managing and enforcing periodic breaks. BreakTaker is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

BreakTaker allows you to customize:

    How long your breaks are and how often you wish to have them
    Whether to be reminded with a simple notification or a fullscreen break window
    Working hours so you are only reminded when you want to be
    The content of messages shown during breaks.
    Whether to intelligently restart your break countdown when it detects that you have not been using the computer
